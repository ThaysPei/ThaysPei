## About me

I focus on building scalable, accessible and maintainable front-end systems.  
I care deeply about code quality, performance and user experience.

Currently working with:
- React
- TypeScript
- Modern CSS
- Performance optimization
- Design Systems

## Development Philosophy

- Readability > cleverness  
- Performance is a feature  
- If it's not accessible, it's broken  
- Every component is a product
